            description:`August is all about tomatoes, and our summer ratatouille recipe is a tasty way to celebrate this sweet, ripe, juicy, fragrant fruit. Ratatouille is not only fun to say but also fun to make. Fresh, in-season tomatoes are critical to this anticancer, gut-supporting, and heart-healthy one-pot dish. The tomatoes are grated or pulsed in a food processor and then cooked with olive oil, onions, garlic, and herbs to create an irresistible cooking base for the other summer vegetables: eggplant, zucchini, summer squash, and bell peppers.

            We recommend making a big batch since leftovers can be used to transform into various other meals. Serve on its own as a satisfying vegetarian main entrée or over grains or pasta (we love it over egg noodles), alongside fish or tofu, folded into an omelet, topped on toasted bread for a savory snack, or blended with yogurt or beans for a flavor-packed dip. Try alongside our herb-based salmon!`,
